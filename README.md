### Angular facesnap simple with unit testing example
Welcome to the Angular facesnap Project! This repository provides a small Angular v15 project based on a course that I had complated in OpenClassroom platform that serves as an excellent starting point for anyone looking to dive into Angular development. It includes a practical example of unit testing in Angular to help you understand the testing concepts and best practices.

Features
- Angular v15: This project is built with the version 15 of Angular, providing you with the most up-to-date features and improvements.
- Easy Setup: Clone this repository, follow the installation instructions, and you'll be up and running in no time.
- Simple Example: The project includes a small but comprehensive example that demonstrates how to write unit tests in Angular (the unit test sample is written very      specifically in the face-snap-list component) using popular testing frameworks like Jasmine and Karma.
- Ready-to-Use Configuration: The project comes with pre-configured test scripts and configurations, so you can focus on writing tests rather than setting up the testing environment.

* Unit Testing Example
This project includes a small example of unit testing an Angular component. The example showcases how to write unit tests for an Angular component using Jasmine as the testing framework and Karma as the test runner. It covers basic concepts like component initialization, DOM interaction, and asserting expected behaviors.

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

- bash
- Copy code
- ng test
This will launch the Karma test runner, which will execute the tests and provide you with the results.
